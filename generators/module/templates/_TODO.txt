Welcome to your new module!

Some quick stuff to finish up before you start developing:
- Create a git repo (`git init && git add . && git commit -am "chore: initial commit"`)
- Create a github repo. (https://github.com/<%= username %>)
- Setup the project on Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org/profile/<%= username %>)
- Setup the project on Coveralls. (https://coveralls.io/repos/new?name=<%= username %>&service=github)
- Setup greenkeeper (`npm i -g greenkeeper; greenkeeper sync; greenkeeper enable`)
- Write code
- Setup semantic-release (`npm i -g semantic-release-cli; semantic-release-cli setup`)
- From then on, pushing to github will build on Travis CI, then push coverage to Coveralls, and if the build passes, publish to npm.
- ???
- Profit.

Enjoy!
